nozzle_xy_position: 162,376
switch_xy_position: 157,348
bed_xy_position: 187.70,154
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates are adjusted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the zero_reference_position which
#   replaces the deprecated relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the zero
#   reference position at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
switch_offset: 0.5
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   A larger value will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This must be determined manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
offset_margins: -1.0,1.0
#   The minimum and maximum margins allowed for the calculated offset.
#   If the offset is outside these values, it will stop!
#   The margin can be defined as "min,max" e.g. "-0.5,1.5" or by just one
#   value e.g. "1.0" which translates to "-1.0,1.0" (which is also the default).
#samples: default from "probe:samples" section
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_result: default from "probe:samples_result" section
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
#safe_z_height: default is 2 * z_offset from the "probe:z_offset" section
#   The absolute z position in mm to move to before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration. The minimum safe z height is 3mm.
#position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 400
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
#lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
#probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is enabled. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing will be faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get down faster and not record the result as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode: Attach_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to run before each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
#before_switch_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to run before to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can
#   be used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: Dock_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to run after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
